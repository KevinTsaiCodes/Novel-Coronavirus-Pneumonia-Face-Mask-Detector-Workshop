## PC base
If you want to use OpenPose without writing any code, simply clone the repository and use the latest Windows/Ubuntu [portable version](https://github.com/KevinTsaiCodes/Novel-Coronavirus-Pneumonia-Face-Mask-Detector-Workshop/tree/main/PC%20Base) of Face Mask Detector!
But, before that. You must setup the environment first. (click here to [setup](https://github.com/KevinTsaiCodes/Novel-Coronavirus-Pneumonia-Face-Mask-Detector-Workshop/wiki/setup))
